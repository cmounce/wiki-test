# Neat things about using GitHub as a wiki
- Markdown editor works well.
- Git is a powerful VCS, and makes an interesting datastore for a wiki.

# Drawbacks of using GitHub as a wiki
## Finding content
- Article titles in search aren't human readable.
- Search result summaries are too long, difficult to skim.

## Contributing content
- Broken links don't let you add new pages.
- Broken links aren't apparent until you click them.
- No redirect pages: moving a page breaks all links.

# Neat things about using GitHub as a wiki
- Markdown editor works well.
- Git is a powerful VCS, and makes an interesting datastore for a wiki.
- I like Markdown better than Wikitext.

# Drawbacks of using GitHub as a wiki
## Finding content
- Article titles in search aren't human readable.
- Search result summaries are too long, difficult to skim.
- GitHub encourages hierarchical organization, which is often hard for readers to reason about.

## Contributing content
- Broken links don't let you add new pages.
- Broken links aren't apparent until you click them.
- No redirect pages: moving a page breaks all links.
- You can't add pictures using the web interface.
- You can have more human-readable links, but the code requires a link definition: hacky compared to MediaWiki.

## Reviewing content
- No per-page alerts.
- You can't revert a commit via the web interface. You can revert pull requests, but not commits.
